# Biography

I am a marine mammal ecologist, currently working for ORCA as a Science Officer analysing and publishing citizen science data, Plymouth University as a Visiting Researcher, and I am also an Associate Editor for Marine Biodiversity Records. Fieldwork has been a large part of my early career, researching seals and cetaceans around the UK, Europe, California, and the Antarctic. I currently focus my time analyzing citizen science data, and supervising university students.
